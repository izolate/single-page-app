# Single Page App
A basic skeleton to rapidily build out a single-page app. I use this to try out new ideas whenever inspiration strikes.

## Task runner

Before running any tasks, make sure your `.env` file is present with all the correct environment variables. For security's sake, this file isn't committedto the repository. Use the example `.env.example` to make your own file with the correct confidential data.

In development, code will have source maps/debug options, and will watch for file changes:

```
$ gulp build

# To enable file-watching
$ gulp develop
```
